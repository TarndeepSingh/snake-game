# Snake Game (OOP) 🐍

A fully object-oriented implementation of the classic Snake game using
Python Turtle graphics. This project focuses on clean architecture,
robust collision handling, and scalable game design.

## Features
- Object-oriented design with clear responsibilities
- Dynamic difficulty (snake speeds up as it grows)
- Accurate collision detection
- High score persistence
- Clean game state management

## Concepts Demonstrated
- OOP principles (encapsulation, separation of concerns)
- Game loop control
- File handling for persistence
- Defensive programming
- Modular project structure

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
